marpaESLIF_API - Extended Marpa's Scanless Interface API

=head1 DESCRIPTION

marpaESLIF is a Scanless Interface expressed in a BNF format, that is using L<marpaWrapper|https://github.com/jddurand/c-marpaWrapper>, itself being a thin interface on top of L<libmarpa|https://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/libmarpa.html> parser.

The whole API is available with this include:

  #include <marpaESLIF.h>

There are four namespaces:

=over

=item ESLIF

=item ESLIFGrammar 

=item ESLIFRecognizer

=item ESLIFValue

=back

=head2 ESLIF

=head3 marpaESLIF_newp

  typedef struct marpaESLIFOption {
    genericLogger_t *genericLoggerp;  /* Logger. Default: NULL */
  } marpaESLIFOption_t;

  marpaESLIF_t           *marpaESLIF_newp(marpaESLIFOption_t *marpaESLIFOptionp);

Any application must start by instanciating a main ESLIF. This method is returning such a main C<marpaESLIF> object, with C<marpaESLIFOptionp> being an eventual pointer to a C<marpaESLIFOption_t> structure. This structure contain:

=over

=item genericLoggerp

A pointer to a C<genericLogger_t> instance. If it is NULL, then C<marpaESLIF> instance, neither any of the other namespaces, will do logging.

=back

=head3 marpaESLIF_freev

  void                    marpaESLIF_freev(marpaESLIF_t *marpaESLIFp);

The C<marpaESLIF> destructor, with parameter C<marpaESLIFp> being an instance previously created.

=head1 NOTES

Any of the object of this API is thread-safe but is not I<reentrant>. That is, if user need to access the same object from different threads, he is responsible of doing sychronization.
