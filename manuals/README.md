This directory contains manuals that explain different parts of Lily. These are
primarily centered around embedding and extending the language in C.

**overview.md** gives a brief overview of Lily's features, and how they
translate to its workings in C.

**extending_lily.md** explains how to use `dyna_tools.py` to build the dynaload
tables that Lily needs. It shows how to add custom classes, methods, vars, and
so on. It also goes into how dynaload works in a little more detail than the
overview.
